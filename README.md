## Overview üí°

This repository is a hub for multiple Arduino UNO-based projects, ranging from basic experiments to more complex applications that integrate sensors, displays, motors, and more! It‚Äôs built with learning in mind and offers a variety of project examples to help you explore the world of embedded electronics.

Each project comes with:
- A brief description of its purpose.
- Required components.
- Code files (.ino).
- Circuit diagrams and instructions on how to build them.

## Project List üìÇ

Here‚Äôs a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

1. **LCD Climate Monitor**: Read temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor and display it on an LCD screen. LEDs blink according to climate data. [Code & Instructions](./Climasync)
2. **Traffic Light System**: Simulates a basic traffic light using LEDs and a timer. [Code & Instructions](link)
3. **Water Level Indicator**: Displays water levels using LEDs and a sensor, ideal for smart water systems. [Code & Instructions](link)
4. **RGB Mood Light**: Control RGB LEDs to change colors based on button presses or sensor input. [Code & Instructions](link)
5. **Button-controlled LED Fader**: Fades an LED in and out when a button is pressed. [Code & Instructions](link)

*... More to come!*
